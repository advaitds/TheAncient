Rewriting my age old C/C++ exercise programs I learned as an undergrad, but now fully in C++. 

The main goals of this repository is to make myself familiar with GitHub, without focusing too much on the kind/quality of  the project. Hence the simple, very basic programs. So the programs mostly are not of any interest. This is mainly for my own practice. Perhaps they may be of some instructional use, but again that is still not the aim here. It can be fine tuned to that if I think about it later.
